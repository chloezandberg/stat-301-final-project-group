    "*Which explanatory variables best predict stars on a GitHub repository?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Surveys confirm that stars are viewed by pratictioners as the most useful measure of a repository's popularity (Borges & Valente, 2018). As GitHub becomes more and more prevalent among developers for use in version control, it can be interesting to see what variables best predict popularity. Recent attempts have been made to solve this problem, such as Moid et. al. with a Random Forest regressor, but no research exists on using mulitple linear regression and LASSO feature selection on this problem (2021). We will explore this below./"

    "If prediction is the project's aim, describe the test data used or how it was created.\n",
